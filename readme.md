# phonemenal

A lot of online dictionaries - while providing audio of spoken words - don't sound the word out. Additionally, the included text pronunciation guide can often be difficult to understand. For instance, the word *pronounce* looks like this: *prəˈnaʊns*.

## Usage
Head on over to [heyseth.github.io/phonemenal](https://heyseth.github.io/phonemenal/). Type in a word - maybe something like; worcestershire, onomatopoeia, or anemone. Click the first button to get an ARPABET representation of your word. ARPABET is basically a set of intuitive letter codes to represent the individual sounds of a word. Click the second button if you would like to hear the word sounded out.

If the word isn't found in Datamuse's database the algorithm will give a guess for the correct pronunciation. A question mark will be displayed after the pronunciation in this case.
